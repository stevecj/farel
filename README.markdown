## DESCRIPTION

This will be a Gem that extends Arel, adding experimental new
functionality, parts of which might be implemented directly in
Arel later once they've proven their stability and usefulness.

## Status

Still setting up the new gem structure.  I have some functioning
spike code elsewhere that implements regular expression matching
for PostgreSQL and MySQL as a proof of concept.  I will be
rewriting a real TDD implementation of that here soon.
